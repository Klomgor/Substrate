# FRED Economic Wellbeing Data Directory

This directory contains data files generated by the update.ts script.

## Files

- **latest.json** - Raw JSON data from FRED API (all indicators with full observation history)
- **latest.txt** - Transformed pipe-delimited format for Substrate (all observations)
- **update.log** - Update script execution log (if present)

## Update Process

Run the update script from the parent directory:

```bash
# Set your FRED API key (get free key at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html)
export FRED_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Run update script
./update.ts
```

## Data Freshness

Different indicators have different update frequencies:
- **Weekly:** Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4), 30-Year Mortgage Rate (MORTGAGE30US)
- **Monthly:** Consumer Sentiment (UMCSENT), Unemployment indicators, Personal Saving Rate (PSAVERT)
- **Quarterly:** Debt Service Ratio (TDSP), Credit Card Delinquency (DRCCLACBS), Median Home Price (MSPUS)
- **Annual:** GINI Income Inequality Index (SIPOVGINIUSA)

Run weekly updates to capture high-frequency indicators; monthly updates sufficient for most indicators.
