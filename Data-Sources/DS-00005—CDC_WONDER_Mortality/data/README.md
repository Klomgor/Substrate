## Data Format

### Raw JSON
Array of mortality records with fields:
- `state` - US state name
- `year` - Year of death
- `deaths` - Number of deaths
- `population` - Population (if available)
- `crudeRate` - Crude death rate per 100,000
- `ageAdjustedRate` - Age-adjusted death rate per 100,000 (if available)

### Pipe-Delimited Format
Substrate standard format:
```
RECORD ID | QUERY TYPE | STATE | YEAR | DEATHS | POPULATION | CRUDE RATE | AGE ADJUSTED RATE
DS-00005-drugOverdose-California-2020 | Drug Overdose Deaths | California | 2020 | 5000 | 39538223 | 12.6 | N/A

## Data Coverage

- **Geographic:** All US states + DC + territories
- **Temporal:** 1999-present (ICD-10 era); most recent data typically 1-2 years lag
- **Frequency:** Annual updates (final data); quarterly (provisional data)
- **Completeness:** Census (100% of deaths, not sample)

## Important Notes

### Cell Suppression
CDC WONDER suppresses cells with counts <10 to protect privacy. Suppressed cells appear as "Suppressed" in results.

### Data Quality
- Drug overdose deaths: May be undercounted by 10-20% due to incomplete toxicology testing
- Suicide deaths: Estimated 20-35% undercount due to classification challenges
- Provisional data: Subject to revision when finalized (can change by 5-10%)

### Rate Calculations
- Crude Rate: Deaths per 100,000 population
- Age-Adjusted Rate: Standardized to 2000 US standard population (enables comparability across populations with different age structures)
