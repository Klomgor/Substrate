## Source Evaluation Narrative

### Methodological Assessment

**Data Collection Methodology:**

**Sampling Design:**
- **Method:** Stratified systematic sample (address-based sampling frame)
- **Sample Size:** 3.5 million addresses annually (~2.5% of US housing units)
- **Sampling Frame:** Master Address File (MAF) - comprehensive list of all US addresses
- **Stratification:** Geographic (states required to have adequate sample), housing unit characteristics
- **Weighting:** Complex weighting to match population controls from population estimates program

**Data Collection Instruments:**
- **Instrument Type:** Standardized questionnaire (paper, web, telephone, in-person)
- **Validation:** Cognitive testing; field testing; OMB approval under Paperwork Reduction Act
- **Question Wording:** Standardized across modes; questions tested for comprehension and bias
- **Mode:** Mixed-mode (mail/internet primary, telephone/in-person follow-up for nonresponse)

**Quality Control Procedures:**
- **Field Supervision:** Regional census centers supervise field operations; real-time quality monitoring
- **Validation Rules:** Automated edit and imputation procedures for missing/inconsistent responses
- **Consistency Checks:** Cross-variable edits (e.g., age vs. school enrollment)
- **Verification:** Reinterview program (10% sample) to verify data collection quality
- **Outlier Treatment:** Statistical edit procedures identify and resolve outliers; extreme values flagged for review

**Error Characteristics:**
- **Sampling Error:** Margins of error (MOE) published for all estimates; 90% confidence intervals
- **Non-sampling Error:** Known issues: nonresponse bias (mitigated by weighting); measurement error in self-reported income, housing values; coverage error (undercounting of hard-to-count populations)
- **Known Biases:** Nonresponse bias in high-poverty, high-minority areas (mitigated through weighting); social desirability bias for sensitive questions
- **Accuracy Bounds:** MOEs published; typical MOE ±3-5% for large geographies, ±10-20% for small areas/rare characteristics

**Methodology Documentation:**
- **Transparency Level:** 5/5 (Exemplary)
- **Documentation URL:** https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology.html
- **Peer Review Status:** Methods reviewed by Census Scientific Advisory Committee; published in peer-reviewed journals
- **Reproducibility:** Full methodology documentation; PUMS microdata enable replication; R/Python packages provide reproducible workflows

### Currency Assessment

**Update Characteristics:**
- **Update Frequency:** Annual (1-year estimates published ~September of following year; 5-year estimates published ~December)
- **Update Reliability:** Consistent annual schedule; rare delays
- **Update Notification:** Email subscription; data release schedule published annually
- **Last Updated:** 2023-09-14 (2022 1-year estimates); 2023-12-07 (2018-2022 5-year estimates)

**Timeliness:**
- **Collection to Publication Lag:**
  - 1-Year Estimates: ~9 months (data collected Jan-Dec 2022 → published Sept 2023)
  - 5-Year Estimates: ~1 year after period end (2018-2022 data → published Dec 2023)
- **Factors Affecting Timeliness:** Data processing, quality review, disclosure avoidance procedures
- **Historical Timeliness:** Generally consistent; COVID-19 pandemic caused operational changes in 2020 (noted in documentation)

**Currency for Different Uses:**
- **Real-time Analysis:** Unsuitable - 9-12 month lag
- **Recent Trends:** Suitable for annual trend analysis; 5-year estimates smooth year-to-year fluctuations
- **Historical Research:** Excellent - consistent time series 2005-present

### Objectivity Assessment

**Potential Biases:**

**Political Bias:**
- **Government Influence:** Census Bureau operates under Title 13 USC protections ensuring statistical independence from political influence
- **Editorial Stance:** Neutral; data published regardless of political implications
- **Political Pressure:** Rare instances of political pressure on citizenship question (2020 census controversy); ACS questions unchanged

**Commercial Bias:**
- **Funding Sources:** Congressional appropriations only; no commercial funding
- **Advertising Influence:** Not applicable
- **Proprietary Interests:** None - all data public domain

**Cultural/Social Bias:**
- **Geographic Bias:** Sample design ensures representation of all geographies; small-area estimates have higher uncertainty
- **Social Perspective:** Questions developed through public input process; tested across diverse populations; some constructs (household, family) reflect legal/administrative definitions that may not capture all lived experiences
- **Language Bias:** Questionnaire available in English and Spanish; telephone assistance in multiple languages; written translations limited
- **Selection Bias:** Question coverage prioritizes federal data needs (OMB standards); some state/local priority topics not included

**Transparency:**
- **Bias Disclosure:** Census Bureau acknowledges data quality issues by geography; MOEs published
- **Limitations Stated:** Comprehensive - methodology documentation notes limitations
- **Raw Data Available:** Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) available; restricted-access microdata available through Federal Statistical Research Data Centers

### Reliability Assessment

**Consistency:**
- **Internal Consistency:** Strong - automated edit procedures ensure logical consistency
- **Temporal Consistency:** Excellent - consistent methodology 2005-present; major changes documented
- **Cross-source Consistency:** Good agreement with CPS, NHIS for overlapping measures; differences explained by sample design

**Stability:**
- **Definition Changes:** Rare - major changes (e.g., relationship categories) phased in with documentation
- **Methodology Changes:** Occasional improvements (e.g., 2013 CAPI instrument redesign); documented in methodology papers
- **Series Breaks:** Clearly marked when definitions change materially (e.g., 2008 industry/occupation coding)

**Verification:**
- **Independent Verification:** Academic researchers extensively validate ACS data quality; errors reported and corrected
- **Replication Studies:** PUMS enable independent replication; Census Bureau publishes design factors for complex variance estimation
- **Audit Results:** Office of Inspector General audits data quality programs; findings public

### Accuracy Assessment

**Validation Evidence:**
- **Benchmark Comparisons:** ACS estimates compared to decennial census, IRS records, Social Security records; generally excellent agreement (within sampling error)
- **Coverage Assessments:** Coverage studies show 98%+ of housing units in sampling frame; known undercount of homeless, non-response in high-poverty areas
- **Error Studies:** Census Bureau publishes data quality reports; content reinterview studies; coverage studies

**Accuracy for Different Uses:**
- **Point Estimates:** Highly reliable for large geographies (states, large counties); MOE ±3-5%; moderate reliability for small areas (census tracts) MOE ±10-20%
- **Trend Analysis:** Reliable for medium-term trends (3-5 years); year-to-year changes should use statistical testing (overlapping MOEs may indicate no significant change)
- **Cross-sectional Comparison:** Reliable for geographic comparisons; use MOEs to determine statistical significance
- **Sub-population Analysis:** Good for large subpopulations (age, sex, race); limited for intersectional analysis in small areas due to sample size

## Known Limitations and Caveats

### Coverage Limitations

**Geographic Gaps:**
- Remote Alaska areas (some villages excluded or sampled at lower rates)
- Homeless individuals not in shelters/group quarters (missed)
- Institutional populations included but sample sizes small for detailed analysis

**Temporal Gaps:**
- No sub-annual data (annual only)
- 2020 data collection impacted by COVID-19 pandemic (operational changes documented)

**Population Exclusions:**
- Homeless not in shelters systematically undercounted
- Undocumented immigrants may be undercounted due to survey nonresponse
- High-nonresponse areas (distressed urban/rural areas) have higher uncertainty

**Variable Gaps:**
- Social capital measures limited (no direct questions on social networks, loneliness, community engagement)
- Mental health not covered (use NHIS or BRFSS)
- Detailed time use beyond commuting not available (use ATUS)

### Methodological Limitations

**Sampling Limitations:**
- Small-area estimates (census tracts, block groups) have high sampling error (MOE ±15-30% for rare characteristics)
- Multi-year aggregation (5-year estimates) necessary for small areas but obscures recent changes
- Rare populations (small race/ethnic groups, disabilities in small areas) have suppressed data or wide MOEs

**Measurement Limitations:**
- Self-reported income and housing values subject to measurement error (non-response, rounding, underreporting)
- Living arrangements measured at survey date (single cross-section doesn't capture fluidity)
- Commute times self-reported (may differ from actual travel times)
- Internet access self-reported (may not reflect quality/speed of connection)

**Processing Limitations:**
- Missing data imputed (introduces uncertainty beyond sampling error)
- Weighting to population controls (assumes nonrespondents similar to respondents in weighting class)
- Disclosure avoidance procedures may introduce small amounts of noise in published estimates

### Comparability Limitations

**Cross-national Comparability:**
- Not applicable (US-only data source)

**Temporal Comparability:**
- Methodology generally consistent 2005-present
- Question wording changes rare but documented (e.g., 2008 industry/occupation recode, 2019 relationship categories expanded)
- 2020 operational changes due to COVID-19 (documented; comparison to prior years should note this)

**Geographic Comparability:**
- Census tract boundaries change every 10 years (use tract equivalency files for time series)
- Some geographies not comparable across years (places incorporate/annex/disincorporate)

**Sub-group Comparability:**
- Small sample sizes for detailed subgroups in small areas result in data suppression or unreliable estimates
- Intersectional analysis limited (e.g., living alone by age by race in census tracts often unavailable)

### Usage Caveats

**Inappropriate Uses:**
1. **DO NOT use 1-year estimates for small areas** - use 5-year estimates for census tracts/block groups (1-year not available)
2. **DO NOT compare overlapping multi-year estimates** - 2017-2021 and 2018-2022 share 4 years of data; not independent comparisons
3. **DO NOT ignore margins of error** - overlapping MOEs = no statistically significant difference
4. **DO NOT use for individual-level inference** - aggregated data; ecological fallacy risk

**Ecological Fallacy Risks:**
- Census tract-level associations don't necessarily hold at individual level
- Example: Tracts with high % living alone may not have higher individual loneliness if those living alone are well-connected

**Correlation vs. Causation:**
- Cross-sectional data; cannot infer causation
- Appropriate for descriptive analysis, hypothesis generation
- Causal inference requires longitudinal designs, individual-level data

**Statistical Significance:**
- Always use MOEs to test for significance before claiming differences
- Census Bureau provides guidance on statistical testing: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/statistical-testing-tool.html

## Recommended Use Cases

### Ideal Applications

**Research Questions Well-Suited:**
1. "Which US communities have the highest rates of living alone (structural isolation)?"
2. "Where are the time poverty hotspots (long commute + low income areas)?"
3. "How has the digital divide changed across US communities 2010-2022?"
4. "What is the relationship between living alone and housing costs at the community level?"
5. "Which neighborhoods have experienced increases in single-person households over the past decade?"

**Analysis Types Supported:**
- Descriptive statistics (rates, medians, percentiles by geography)
- Trend analysis (time series by community)
- Geographic comparison (cross-sectional comparison of communities)
- Correlation analysis (relationships between indicators - ecological level)
- Spatial analysis (mapping, clustering, hot spot detection)

### Appropriate Contexts

**Geographic Contexts:**
- National analysis (US-wide patterns)
- State comparisons
- Metropolitan area analysis
- County-level analysis
- Census tract/block group analysis (use 5-year estimates)
- Custom geographies (aggregated from tracts)

**Temporal Contexts:**
- Long-term trends (2005-present)
- Medium-term trends (5-10 years most reliable)
- Recent snapshot (use 1-year for large areas, 5-year for small areas)

**Subject Contexts:**
- Social isolation and connection (living arrangements)
- Time poverty and commuting burden
- Digital divide and internet access
- Housing affordability and security
- Economic wellbeing and employment
- Community demographic change

### Use Warnings

**Avoid Using This Source For:**
1. **Individual-level analysis** → Use PUMS microdata if available, or individual-level surveys (NHIS, BRFSS, ATUS)
2. **Real-time monitoring** → Use administrative data, real-time surveys
3. **Causal inference** → Use longitudinal panel data, quasi-experimental designs
4. **Small populations in small areas** → Data suppressed or unreliable; use larger geographic aggregation
5. **Sub-annual trends** → Annual data only; use monthly surveys (CPS) for sub-annual trends

**Recommended Alternatives For:**
- Individual-level analysis → PUMS microdata (larger sampling error but individual records)
- More timely data → Current Population Survey (state-level, monthly)
- Social capital measures → General Social Survey, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
- Detailed time use → American Time Use Survey
- Longitudinal analysis → Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)

## Cataloger Notes

**Internal Notes:**
- CRITICAL source for US social wellbeing measurement; authoritative and most granular public data
- API well-documented; rate limits low (500/day) but manageable with proper throttling
- Margins of error essential for statistical testing - must include in analysis
- 5-year estimates necessary for census tract-level analysis (1-year not available)
- Living alone (B11001_008E) and commute times (B08303) are key structural social isolation/time poverty indicators
- Digital divide measures (B28002, B28003) critical for opportunity access analysis

**To Do:**
- [x] Create comprehensive source.md
- [ ] Create update.ts script with API key handling and rate limiting
- [ ] Test API access with sample queries
- [ ] Document key variable combinations for social wellbeing analysis
- [ ] Cross-reference with Substrate Problems and Solutions once defined

**Questions for Review:**
- Should we pre-fetch specific indicator tables or fetch on-demand?
- How to handle 1-year vs 5-year estimates (separate source entries or version parameter)?
- What geographic granularity to prioritize (tracts, counties, states)?
