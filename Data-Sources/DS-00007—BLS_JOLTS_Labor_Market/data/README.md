## Permission to Quit Index

The quit rate is the **most important indicator** in this data source. It measures worker agency and economic confidence:

- **High quit rate (â‰¥2.5%)** = Workers feel empowered, have options, can leave bad jobs
- **Moderate quit rate (2.0-2.5%)** = Some worker confidence, but many may feel trapped
- **Low quit rate (<2.0%)** = Workers feel trapped, lack confidence to quit even unsatisfying jobs

## Update Schedule

Data is updated monthly, approximately 6 weeks after the reference month (around the 10th of month+2).

Example: September data is typically published around November 10.
