## About

### The Philosophy

Substrate is built on a simple but powerful idea: **meaningful progress requires connecting ideas to evidence, and claims to data**.

Knowledge exists everywhere, but it's often disconnected. Claims are made without clear evidence. Arguments reference data that's hard to verify. Solutions are proposed without examining what's worked before. Public records sit in separate databases, difficult to cross-reference.

Substrate addresses this by creating an **interconnected knowledge system** where every component links to related components:

- **Claims** ‚Üî **Arguments** ‚Üî **Data** ‚Üí Build evidence-based positions
- **Problems** ‚Üî **Solutions** ‚Üî **Experiments** ‚Üí Test what actually works
- **Organizations** ‚Üî **People** ‚Üî **Projects** ‚Üí Track who's doing what
- **Values** ‚Üî **Models** ‚Üî **Ideas** ‚Üí Connect worldviews to frameworks
- **Authoritative Datasets** ‚Üí Ground everything in verified facts

### Human & AI Collaboration

**Substrate provides the pieces. You and your AI create the connections.**

We don't prescribe how everything links together‚Äîwe provide the **raw components** (problems, solutions, data, claims, arguments, people, organizations) in structured, machine-readable formats. The mappings happen organically:

- **Humans discover connections** - "This solution worked for that problem in 3 cities"
- **AI systems suggest links** - "These 5 arguments all reference the same dataset"
- **Patterns emerge automatically** - "Every organization in this funding network connects to these 3 politicians"
- **Connections grow over time** - As more data and entities are added, new relationships surface

Everything in Substrate is designed to be parsed and analyzed by **both humans and AI systems**:

- **Human-readable formats** - CSV and Markdown files anyone can open and understand
- **Machine-parseable structures** - Consistent formats AI can query and analyze
- **Complete documentation** - Full methodology and source evaluation for every dataset
- **Standardized identifiers** - Link entities across datasets without ambiguity

This dual accessibility enables a new kind of collaboration: humans contribute the pieces and initial insights, AI systems analyze thousands of components simultaneously to find patterns and suggest connections that would be impossible to spot manually. The system becomes more valuable as more people and AIs explore it, each discovering and documenting new linkages.

### The Vision

By connecting claims to arguments, arguments to data, and data to authoritative sources, Substrate creates a **foundation for mutual understanding**. When we disagree, we can trace our reasoning back through evidence to see exactly where our perspectives diverge. When we agree, we can build on verified knowledge rather than assumptions.

### Transparency & Accountability

Substrate's interconnected structure enables powerful transparency use cases:

**üîç OSINT & Investigation**
- Cross-reference public records, corporate filings, and government data
- Link people, organizations, and financial flows across datasets
- Surface connections that would be invisible in isolated databases
- Track influence networks and funding relationships

**üìä Criminal Investigation Support**
- Connect individuals to organizations, transactions, and locations using public data
- Build evidence chains linking claims to verifiable records
- Correlate timeline data across multiple authoritative sources
- Enable pattern detection across datasets (fraud, corruption, illicit networks)

**üåê Public Accountability**
- Verify claims made by public figures against documented evidence
- Track campaign promises against actual policy outcomes and metrics
- Link political donations to voting records and policy positions
- Monitor government spending against stated goals and results

This isn't just an academic exercise‚Äîit's infrastructure for transparency and progress. Whether you're a researcher seeking ground-truth data, an investigator cross-referencing public records, a journalist fact-checking claims, or a citizen trying to understand complex issues, Substrate provides a trusted foundation built on verifiable evidence and open data.

### How It Works: Community Contributions

Substrate is a **collaborative platform** where anyone can contribute:

**üìã Problems** - Identify challenges facing communities, nations, or humanity
- Submit new problems with context and supporting evidence
- Link to relevant data showing scope and impact
- Example: "Toxic water in poor US cities" ‚Üí linked to WHO water quality data

**üí° Solutions** - Propose evidence-based approaches
- Suggest solutions to documented problems
- Reference similar implementations and their outcomes
- Connect to experimental results and real-world case studies

**üó£Ô∏è Arguments** - Build reasoning with quality ratings
- Construct logical arguments supporting or opposing positions
- **Quality spectrum:** Arguments rated from shoddy to highly credible based on:
  - Data backing (authoritative sources vs. anecdotes)
  - Logical coherence (sound reasoning vs. fallacies)
  - Evidence strength (peer-reviewed studies vs. opinions)
- AI and community review help surface well-supported arguments

**üìä Plans** - Actionable strategies for real change
- **Political platforms** for candidates running for office
- **Action plans** for fixing cities, states, or countries
- **Policy proposals** with implementation roadmaps and metrics
- Each plan linked to problems it addresses and solutions it employs

**üìà Metrics** - Measure what matters
- Define success criteria for solutions and plans
- Track implementation progress against goals
- Link outcomes to authoritative datasets for verification
- Enable evidence-based iteration and improvement

### Integration with TELOS

Substrate integrates with the **[TELOS framework](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Telos)** for structured goal management:

**What is TELOS?** An open-source framework for capturing Deep Context about entities‚Äîfrom individuals to organizations to nations‚Äîdefining their purpose, goals, strategies, and challenges.

**How they connect:**
- **TELOS Goals** ‚Üî **Substrate Problems** - What you want to achieve vs. what stands in the way
- **TELOS Strategies** ‚Üî **Substrate Solutions** - How you'll pursue goals vs. proven approaches
- **TELOS Challenges** ‚Üî **Substrate Data** - Obstacles you face vs. measured evidence
- **TELOS Metrics** ‚Üî **Substrate Plans** - How you track progress vs. implementation roadmaps

Together, they create a complete system: TELOS provides the *intention* (goals, strategies), Substrate provides the *evidence* (data, arguments, proven solutions).

**How Mappings Happen:**

Substrate provides structured components‚Äîthe rest happens automatically through:

1. **Human Curation** - Users explicitly link problems to solutions, claims to data
2. **AI Analysis** - Language models scan components and suggest relationships
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Algorithms detect recurring connections across entities
4. **Collaborative Discovery** - Multiple users find and validate the same linkages
5. **Automated Inference** - Systems propose connections based on shared attributes

You contribute the pieces. Your AI helps map them. The knowledge graph grows organically.

**Future Capabilities:**
- Real-time link discovery across new data sources
- Automated pattern detection for investigative workflows
- Interactive graph visualization for exploring connections
- API access for programmatic queries across linked entities
- Machine learning to suggest relevant connections based on context
- Confidence scoring for AI-suggested mappings

### History

Substrate was launched in **July 2024** with a vision to create shared infrastructure for human knowledge. The project began with 17 core object types (Problems, Solutions, Ideas, Plans, Values, Models, Arguments, Claims, etc.) and has grown through community contributions and a major data infrastructure initiative in October 2025.

**Mission:** Build a trusted foundation of ground-truth data and structured knowledge to support human understanding and progress.
