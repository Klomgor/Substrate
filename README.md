## About

**Substrate** is an open-source framework for capturing, organizing, and analyzing different aspects of human civilization. It provides a structured knowledge system covering problems, solutions, plans, experiments, and empirical data—all interconnected and designed to be analyzed by both humans and AI systems.

The project combines:
- **Conceptual Components**: Problems, Solutions, Ideas, Plans, Values, Models, Arguments, Claims
- **Empirical Data**: Curated ground-truth datasets from authoritative sources
- **Organizational Elements**: People, Projects, Organizations, Funding Sources
- **Outcome Tracking**: Results, Experiments, Metrics, Risks

### Data Directory

Substrate includes a **Data/** directory with authoritative, ground-truth datasets about important aspects of human life, society, and progress. All datasets come from verified, reputable sources and are provided in human-readable CSV and Markdown formats.

**Current Datasets:**

We're working on a web-based interface for this as well to make it easier for non-coders to contribute.
