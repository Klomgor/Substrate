## Source Evaluation Narrative

### Methodological Assessment

**Data Collection Methodology:**

**Sampling Design:**
- **Method:** Probability sample (scientifically-selected retail establishments and items)
- **Sample Size:** ~23,000 retail and service establishments; ~80,000 price quotes monthly
- **Sampling Frame:** Universe of U.S. urban retail establishments
- **Stratification:** By item category, geographic region, establishment type
- **Weighting:** Expenditure weights from Consumer Expenditure Survey (updated every 2 years)

**Data Collection Instruments:**
- **Instrument Type:** Direct price observation (in-person and online price collection)
- **Validation:** BLS field supervisors verify price quotes; automated consistency checks
- **Question Wording:** Standardized price collection protocols (exact item specifications)
- **Mode:** In-person visits (grocery, retail), phone (services), online (e-commerce)

**Quality Control Procedures:**
- **Field Supervision:** BLS regional offices supervise price collectors
- **Validation Rules:** Automated checks for price changes >10%; item substitution protocols
- **Consistency Checks:** Cross-validation across similar items and geographic areas
- **Verification:** Monthly review by BLS economists
- **Outlier Treatment:** Large price changes investigated and verified before inclusion

**Error Characteristics:**
- **Sampling Error:** Very low for national CPI (large sample); confidence intervals not published
- **Non-sampling Error:** Item substitution bias, quality adjustment challenges, new product introduction lag
- **Known Biases:** Upward bias (~0.5-1.0% annually) from substitution, quality changes (Boskin Commission findings)
- **Accuracy Bounds:** Academic estimates suggest ±0.1-0.3% for monthly CPI

**Methodology Documentation:**
- **Transparency Level:** 5/5 (Exemplary)
- **Documentation URL:** https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cpi/
- **Peer Review Status:** BLS methods reviewed by National Academy of Sciences; published in peer-reviewed journals
- **Reproducibility:** Methodology fully documented; data collection procedures published

### Currency Assessment

**Update Characteristics:**
- **Update Frequency:** Monthly (released mid-month, typically day 12-15)
- **Update Reliability:** Extremely consistent; releases follow strict schedule (8:30 AM ET)
- **Update Notification:** BLS release calendar published; FRED email alerts available
- **Last Updated:** 2025-08 (most recent as of October 2025)

**Timeliness:**
- **Collection to Publication Lag:** ~2 weeks (data for month M published mid-month M+1)
- **Factors Affecting Timeliness:** Price collection window, quality review process
- **Historical Timeliness:** Consistent monthly release schedule maintained for decades

**Currency for Different Uses:**
- **Real-time Analysis:** Unsuitable (2-week lag); most current available for monthly data
- **Recent Trends:** Excellent (monthly updates capture trends within 6 weeks)
- **Historical Research:** Excellent (continuous series 1947-present)

### Objectivity Assessment

**Potential Biases:**

**Political Bias:**
- **Government Influence:** Statistical agency independence protected by law; BLS Commissioner serves under civil service
- **Editorial Stance:** Professional statistical neutrality mandated by statute
- **Political Pressure:** Occasional political commentary on CPI methodology; independence maintained

**Commercial Bias:**
- **Funding Sources:** Federal appropriations (no commercial interests)
- **Advertising Influence:** Not applicable
- **Proprietary Interests:** None

**Cultural/Social Bias:**
- **Geographic Bias:** Urban-centric (excludes rural 7%); 75 urban areas weighted by population
- **Social Perspective:** Average consumer basket may not reflect low-income or high-income consumption
- **Language Bias:** Published in English; limited translation
- **Selection Bias:** Item selection based on Consumer Expenditure Survey (updated every 2 years)

**Transparency:**
- **Bias Disclosure:** BLS acknowledges known biases (substitution, quality adjustment); Boskin Commission documented
- **Limitations Stated:** Comprehensive methodology documentation notes limitations
- **Raw Data Available:** Detailed CPI components published; micro-data not publicly available (establishment confidentiality)

### Reliability Assessment

**Consistency:**
- **Internal Consistency:** Item-level CPIs aggregate mathematically to headline CPI
- **Temporal Consistency:** Stable methodology; major changes documented and phased in gradually
- **Cross-source Consistency:** Good agreement with PCE Price Index, IMF WEO inflation data

**Stability:**
- **Definition Changes:** Occasional - major methodology updates implemented gradually (e.g., geometric mean, hedonic quality adjustment)
- **Methodology Changes:** Well-documented; typically phased in over years
- **Series Breaks:** Clearly marked when major changes implemented (base period changes)

**Verification:**
- **Independent Verification:** Academic economists extensively study CPI; Boskin Commission independent review
- **Replication Studies:** Researchers use CPI data extensively; errors/discrepancies reported and corrected
- **Audit Results:** GAO audits BLS periodically; no major data quality issues identified

### Accuracy Assessment

**Validation Evidence:**
- **Benchmark Comparisons:** CPI compared to PCE Price Index (Federal Reserve preferred measure); differences documented
- **Coverage Assessments:** Expenditure weights updated from Consumer Expenditure Survey
- **Error Studies:** Boskin Commission (1996) estimated upward bias ~1.1% annually; BLS improvements reduced to ~0.5%

**Accuracy for Different Uses:**
- **Point Estimates:** Highly reliable for national monthly CPI (large sample)
- **Trend Analysis:** Excellent for medium-term trends (6+ months); month-to-month noise exists
- **Cross-sectional Comparison:** Not applicable (U.S. only); international comparisons use Harmonized Indices
- **Sub-population Analysis:** Limited - metropolitan area CPIs available; no income-specific CPIs

---

## Known Limitations and Caveats

### Coverage Limitations

**Geographic Gaps:**
- Rural non-metropolitan areas (~7% of U.S. population)
- Alaska and Hawaii covered separately (not in national index)

**Temporal Gaps:**
- No gaps in monthly series since 1947
- Earlier data (1913-1946) less frequent or different methodology

**Population Exclusions:**
- Rural populations
- Military personnel on base
- Institutionalized populations (prisons, nursing homes)

**Variable Gaps:**
- No individual consumption pattern adjustments (average consumer only)
- No wealth or asset price changes (home prices, stocks)
- Services quality changes challenging to capture

### Methodological Limitations

**Sampling Limitations:**
- Item substitution when products discontinued (introduces quality adjustment challenges)
- New products introduced with lag (e.g., smartphones took years to enter basket)

**Measurement Limitations:**
- Quality improvements difficult to separate from price increases (hedonic quality adjustment imperfect)
- Online prices increasingly important; methodology adapting
- Shrinkflation (smaller package size for same price) challenging to capture

**Processing Limitations:**
- Seasonal adjustment can mask underlying trends
- Base period changes (1982-1984 = 100) require careful interpretation for long-term comparisons

### Comparability Limitations

**Cross-national Comparability:**
- Different countries use different CPI methodologies
- Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) used for international comparisons

**Temporal Comparability:**
- Methodology improvements over time (geometric mean, hedonic quality, internet prices)
- Base period re-anchored periodically (does not affect inflation rates, but index levels)

**Sub-group Comparability:**
- No income-specific CPIs (average consumer only)
- Metropolitan area CPIs exist but smaller samples (wider confidence intervals)

### Usage Caveats

**Inappropriate Uses:**
1. **DO NOT use for individual consumption** - reflects average urban consumer, not personal basket
2. **DO NOT use as cost-of-living index** - does not fully account for substitution or quality
3. **DO NOT compare month-to-month** without considering seasonal patterns and noise
4. **DO NOT use for asset prices** - excludes home prices, stocks, bonds (use Case-Shiller, S&P500)

**Ecological Fallacy Risks:**
- National CPI does not reflect individual cities (use metropolitan CPIs)
- Average CPI does not reflect low-income or high-income consumption patterns

**Correlation vs. Causation:**
- CPI measures price changes, not causes of inflation
- Appropriate for descriptive analysis, not causal inference without economic models

---

## Recommended Use Cases

### Ideal Applications

**Research Questions Well-Suited:**
1. "How has U.S. purchasing power changed over the past 50 years?"
2. "What is the real (inflation-adjusted) return on investment?"
3. "How does wage growth compare to inflation?"
4. "What is the Federal Reserve's progress toward 2% inflation target?"

**Analysis Types Supported:**
- Descriptive statistics (inflation rates over time)
- Trend analysis (long-term inflation patterns)
- Real value adjustments (converting nominal to real dollars)
- Policy evaluation (Federal Reserve inflation targeting)

### Appropriate Contexts

**Geographic Contexts:**
- U.S. national analysis
- Cross-country comparisons (with Harmonized Indices or equivalent)

**Temporal Contexts:**
- Long-term trends (1947-present)
- Historical research (especially post-WWII era)
- Month-to-month changes (with seasonal adjustment consideration)

**Subject Contexts:**
- Purchasing power analysis
- Real wage calculations
- Retirement planning (Social Security COLA)
- Economic policy evaluation

### Use Warnings

**Avoid Using This Source For:**
1. **Individual consumption patterns** → Use personal budget tracking
2. **Real estate price inflation** → Use Case-Shiller Home Price Index
3. **Asset price changes** → Use stock indices, bond yields
4. **Immediate/real-time inflation** → Use high-frequency alternative data (Billion Prices Project)
5. **Rural cost of living** → No rural CPI available

**Recommended Alternatives For:**
- Federal Reserve policy → PCE Price Index (Fed's preferred measure)
- Producer/wholesale prices → Producer Price Index (PPI)
- Import/export prices → Import/Export Price Indices
- Wage earner specific → CPI-W (Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers)
