## Confidence Levels & Data Gaps

### High Confidence Findings (85%+)
- U.S. total compensation: $10-11 trillion
- U.S. workforce size: 100 million knowledge workers
- Sector-specific salary averages (multiple source corroboration)
- BLS government data accuracy

### Medium Confidence Findings (65%)
- Global total compensation: $50-70 trillion (requires extensive aggregation)
- Exact global workforce count (described as "1+ billion")
- Regional averages (limited occupation-specific data from international orgs)

### Critical Data Gaps Identified
- **No occupation-specific knowledge worker data** from OECD, World Bank, ILO in standard reports
- **Equity compensation not captured** in BLS surveys (stock options, RSUs)
- **Global estimates require manual aggregation** from individual country statistical agencies
- **"Knowledge worker" definition varies** by source and region

## Calculation Methodology

### U.S. Total Compensation
```
Conservative: 100M workers × $100,000 avg = $10 trillion
Upper bound:  100M workers × $110,000 avg = $11 trillion

Sector-weighted average:
- Tech: $112,521
- Finance: $150,453
- Healthcare: $83,090
- Professional services: $97,604
→ Weighted avg: ~$100-110K
```

### Global Total Compensation
```
Conservative: 1B workers × $50,000 avg = $50 trillion
Upper bound:  1B workers × $70,000 avg = $70 trillion

Regional distribution assumption:
- U.S.: ~10% of workers at 3× global avg
- Europe: ~25% at 1.5× global avg
- Asia-Pacific: ~50% at 0.8× global avg
- Latin America/Other: ~15% at 0.5× global avg
```
