- **Editorial Stance:** Research compilation neutral
- **Political Pressure:** None

**Commercial Bias:**
- **Funding Sources:** Consulting firms (Robert Half, Payscale) have commercial interests in salary data
- **Advertising Influence:** Not applicable
- **Proprietary Interests:** Some sources proprietary (Glassdoor, Payscale)

**Cultural/Social Bias:**
- **Geographic Bias:** U.S.-centric (better data coverage); Western Europe overrepresented
- **Social Perspective:** Knowledge worker focus excludes non-knowledge sectors

## Known Limitations and Caveats

### Coverage Limitations

**Geographic Gaps:**
- Africa (minimal data available)
- Middle East (limited coverage)
- Rural areas (knowledge workers concentrated in urban centers)

**Temporal Gaps:**
- Single snapshot (2024-2025)
- No historical time series

**Population Exclusions:**
- Non-knowledge workers (by design)
- Informal economy knowledge workers
- Gig economy workers (partial coverage)

**Variable Gaps:**
- Equity compensation not captured in most sources (stock options, RSUs)
- Benefits variation across countries
- Demographic breakdowns limited

### Methodological Limitations

**Sampling Limitations:**
- Varies by source (BLS high quality; self-reported surveys lower quality)
- Self-selection bias in Glassdoor, Payscale user-generated data

**Measurement Limitations:**
- "Knowledge worker" definition inconsistent across sources
- Purchasing power parity adjustments not uniformly applied
- Exchange rate fluctuations affect cross-country comparisons

**Processing Limitations:**
- Aggregation across sources with different methodologies
- Confidence levels estimated (not statistically rigorous)

### Comparability Limitations

**Cross-national Comparability:**
- Definitional differences (what constitutes "knowledge worker")
- PPP adjustments needed for true cost-of-living comparisons
- Tax and benefit systems vary (gross vs. net compensation)

**Temporal Comparability:**
- Single snapshot (cannot assess trends)

**Sub-group Comparability:**
- Limited demographic data (gender, race, education level)

### Usage Caveats

**Inappropriate Uses:**
1. **DO NOT use for precise individual salary negotiations** - broad averages only
2. **DO NOT assume global estimates are highly accurate** - medium confidence (65%)
3. **DO NOT use for historical trend analysis** - single snapshot
4. **DO NOT assume equity compensation included** - most sources cash compensation only
5. **DO NOT use without PPP adjustment** - cross-country comparisons need cost-of-living adjustment

**Ecological Fallacy Risks:**
- National/sector averages do not reflect individual company or role compensation
- Regional averages mask within-country variation

**Correlation vs. Causation:**
- Compensation levels do not imply causation
- Appropriate for descriptive analysis only

---

## Recommended Use Cases

### Ideal Applications

**Research Questions Well-Suited:**
1. "What is the global knowledge worker compensation market size?"
2. "How do U.S. tech salaries compare to European tech salaries?"
3. "What is the AI/ML skills premium in 2025?"
4. "What percentage of the U.S. workforce are knowledge workers?"

**Analysis Types Supported:**
- Descriptive statistics (compensation averages by geography/sector)
- Cross-country comparison (regional salary differences)
- Sector analysis (technology vs. finance vs. healthcare)
- Skills premium analysis (AI/ML vs. general software engineering)

### Appropriate Contexts

**Geographic Contexts:**
- U.S. national analysis (high confidence)
- Western Europe comparison (medium confidence)
- Global overview (medium confidence)

**Temporal Contexts:**
- Current snapshot (2024-2025)
- Short-term growth trends (YoY)

**Subject Contexts:**
- Knowledge economy labor markets
- Technology sector compensation
- STEM workforce analysis
- Consulting and professional services

### Use Warnings

**Avoid Using This Source For:**
1. **Individual salary negotiation** → Use role-specific Glassdoor, Payscale
2. **Historical trend analysis** → Single snapshot; need time series data
3. **Precise global estimates** → Medium confidence (65%); use OECD, ILO for official stats
4. **Equity compensation analysis** → Most sources exclude stock options/RSUs
5. **Demographic analysis** → Limited demographic breakdowns

**Recommended Alternatives For:**
- U.S. official statistics → BLS OEWS (Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics)
- Global official statistics → OECD Average Wages, ILO Global Wage Report
- Tech sector depth → Dice Tech Salary Report, Stack Overflow Developer Survey
- Equity compensation → Carta Equity Report, Glassdoor total compensation
- Real-time data → Glassdoor, Payscale (updated continuously)

## Cataloger Notes

**Internal Notes:**
- Unique tertiary source; multi-agent research compilation
- U.S. data high confidence (85%); Global medium confidence (65%)
- Future updates require re-research (not automated)
- Consider annual update schedule (October/November)
- Equity compensation gap noted (most sources exclude stock options/RSUs)

**To Do:**
- [ ] Annual update (October 2026) with new research cycle
- [ ] Consider adding demographic breakdowns if data becomes available
- [ ] Explore equity compensation data sources (Carta, Glassdoor total comp)
- [ ] Add Africa and Middle East data if sources improve

**Questions for Review:**
- Should this be updated quarterly or annually?
- How to handle exchange rate fluctuations in cross-country comparisons?
- Should we add PPP-adjusted values?
