## Calculation Methodologies

### U.S. Total Compensation

**Formula:**
```
Total Compensation = Workforce Size Ã— Average Compensation
= 100 million workers Ã— $100,000-$110,000 avg
= $10-11 trillion annually
```

**Components Included (BLS Method):**
- Wages and salaries (68.8-70.3% of total)
- Benefits (29.7-31.2% of total):
  - Health insurance
  - Retirement contributions
  - Paid leave
  - Supplemental pay (bonuses, overtime)
  - Legally required benefits (Social Security, Medicare, unemployment)

**Not Included (Data Gap):**
- Equity compensation (stock options, RSUs) - BLS does not systematically track
- Actual total comp likely 10-30% higher in tech/finance when equity included

### Global Total Compensation

**Formula:**
```
Conservative: 1 billion workers Ã— $50,000 avg = $50 trillion
Upper bound: 1 billion workers Ã— $70,000 avg = $70 trillion
```

**Regional Distribution Assumptions:**
- U.S.: ~10% of global knowledge workers at 3Ã— global average
- Europe: ~25% at 1.5Ã— global average
- Asia-Pacific: ~50% at 0.8Ã— global average
- Latin America/Other: ~15% at 0.5Ã— global average

   - Despite modest +1.2% YoY wage growth
   - Talent scarcity and remote work driving costs

## Data Gaps & Limitations

### Critical Gaps Identified

1. **No occupation-specific knowledge worker data from international orgs**
   - OECD, World Bank, ILO publish general wage stats
   - Do NOT break down by professional/technical/knowledge worker categories
   - Must aggregate from individual country statistical agencies

2. **Equity compensation not captured in BLS surveys**
   - Stock options and RSUs excluded from Employment Cost Index
   - Particularly impacts tech and finance sector accuracy
   - Private sector uses ASC 718 accounting standards (not in government data)

3. **Freelance and gig economy undercounting**
   - Traditional surveys may miss independent knowledge workers
   - Upwork: 28% freelance rate may not reflect in BLS employment figures

### Confidence Levels

**High Confidence (85%+):**
- U.S. total compensation: $10-11 trillion
- U.S. workforce size: 100M knowledge workers
- Sector-specific salary averages (multiple source corroboration)
- BLS government data accuracy

**Medium Confidence (65%):**
- Global total compensation: $50-70 trillion
- Exact global workforce count (described as "1+ billion")
- Regional averages (limited occupation-specific international data)

**Low Confidence (<50%):**
- Equity compensation total market value (not systematically tracked)
- Freelance knowledge worker total compensation (incomplete data)

## Update Schedule

**Recommended Update Frequency:**
- **Quarterly**: After BLS Employment Cost Index releases (~3 months after quarter end)
