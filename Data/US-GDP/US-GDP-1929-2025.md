## Technical Details

### Measurement Methodology

**What is GDP:**
Gross Domestic Product measures the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific period.

**Three Approaches:**
1. **Production Approach**: Sum of value added at each production stage
2. **Expenditure Approach**: Sum of consumption + investment + government + net exports
3. **Income Approach**: Sum of all income earned in production

BEA primarily uses expenditure approach: GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
- C = Personal consumption expenditures
- I = Gross private domestic investment
- G = Government consumption and investment
- X = Exports
- M = Imports

**Real vs Nominal GDP:**
- **Real GDP** (this dataset): Adjusted for inflation using chained 2017 dollars
- **Nominal GDP**: Measured in current prices without inflation adjustment
- Real GDP enables valid comparisons across time periods

**Chained Dollar Method:**
- Uses 2017 as reference year
- "Chained" methodology accounts for changing spending patterns
- More accurate than fixed-weight indexes for long-term analysis
- Base year updated periodically by BEA

**Seasonal Adjustment (Quarterly Only):**
- Removes predictable seasonal patterns
- Allows for clearer trend identification
- Annual data not seasonally adjusted (seasonal effects average out)

### Data Validation

**Verification Checksums:**
```bash
# Quarterly data
md5sum Real-GDP-Quarterly-1947-2025.csv
wc -l Real-GDP-Quarterly-1947-2025.csv  # Should be 315

# Annual data
md5sum Real-GDP-Annual-1929-2024.csv
wc -l Real-GDP-Annual-1929-2024.csv  # Should be 97
```

**Expected Ranges:**
- Quarterly (GDPC1): ~2,000 to ~24,000 billion (1947-2025)
- Annual (GDPCA): ~800 to ~24,000 billion (1929-2024)
- Growth rate: Typically -5% to +10% year-over-year

**Data Integrity Checks:**
1. No missing observation dates
2. All GDP values are positive numbers
3. No duplicate dates
4. Dates in chronological order
5. Quarterly dates align with calendar quarters (01-01, 04-01, 07-01, 10-01)
6. Annual dates all use 01-01
