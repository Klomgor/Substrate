## Overview

This directory contains authoritative U.S. GDP data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) system, which sources directly from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). GDP is the primary measure of economic activity, representing the total value of all goods and services produced within the United States.

## Dataset Specifications

### Coverage

**Quarterly Data (GDPC1):**
- **Geographic**: United States
- **Temporal**: Q1 1947 - Q2 2025 (78+ years, 314 quarters)
- **Frequency**: Quarterly
- **Latest**: Q2 2025: $23,770.976 billion (chained 2017 dollars)

**Annual Data (GDPCA):**
- **Geographic**: United States
- **Temporal**: 1929 - 2024 (96 years)
- **Frequency**: Annual
- **Latest**: 2024: $23,358.435 billion (chained 2017 dollars)

### Metrics

- **Measurement**: Real Gross Domestic Product (inflation-adjusted)
- **Format**: Chained 2017 dollars (billions)
- **Adjustment**: Seasonally adjusted (quarterly), not seasonally adjusted (annual)
- **Type**: Real GDP (not nominal) - preferred for economic analysis and historical comparisons

### Data Quality

- **Completeness**: 100% coverage (314 quarters, 96 years)
- **Reliability**: Highest (official government economic statistic)
- **Timeliness**: Three releases per quarter with progressive data refinement
- **Accessibility**: Direct CSV download, no authentication required

## Real vs Nominal GDP

This dataset uses **Real GDP** (inflation-adjusted) rather than nominal GDP:

**Why Real GDP:**
- Enables meaningful comparisons across time periods
- Removes distortion from price changes
- BEA features real GDP growth as key economic activity metric
- Preferred by economists and policymakers for trend analysis
- Better for understanding actual economic output changes

**Nominal GDP** (current dollars) is used when:
- Calculating current economic values
- Analyzing price level changes
- Computing GDP deflator

Both real and nominal have identical availability (quarterly 1947+, annual 1929+), but real GDP is the standard for economic analysis.

## Extended Historical Coverage

**MeasuringWorth (Johnston & Williamson)**
- **Coverage**: 1790 to present
- **URL**: https://www.measuringworth.com/datasets/usgdp/
- **Note**: Pre-1929 data uses retrospective estimates by economic historians
- Links historical estimates to modern BEA data for continuity
- Based on benchmark years with interpolation
- Less suitable for sophisticated time series analysis but valuable for long-term context

## Current Economic Context (as of 2025-10-16)

- **Latest Quarterly Reading**: Q2 2025: $23,770.976 billion (real)
- **Recent Growth**: Q2 2025 showed 3.8% annualized growth

## Data Interpretation Notes

1. **Real vs Nominal**:
   - This dataset uses real GDP (chained 2017 dollars)
   - Real GDP removes inflation effects, enabling valid comparisons across time
   - To convert to nominal GDP, multiply by GDP deflator and divide by 100

2. **Growth Rate Calculation**:
   - Quarter-over-quarter: ((GDP_current - GDP_previous) / GDP_previous) × 100
   - Year-over-year: ((GDP_current - GDP_1year_ago) / GDP_1year_ago) × 100
   - Annualized quarterly growth: Quarter-over-quarter growth × 4

3. **Seasonally Adjusted (Quarterly)**:
   - Quarterly data is seasonally adjusted to remove regular patterns
   - Allows for cleaner trend identification and period comparisons
   - Annual data is not seasonally adjusted (seasonal effects average out over year)

4. **Business Cycle Dating**:
   - Two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth = technical recession
   - NBER (National Bureau of Economic Research) provides official recession dating
   - GDP is primary but not sole indicator used for recession determination

5. **Chained Dollars Method**:
   - Uses 2017 as base year reference
   - "Chained" method better accounts for changes in spending patterns over time
   - More accurate for long-term comparisons than fixed-weight indexes

## Maintenance

See **UPDATES.md** for detailed change log of data refreshes and updates.

**Update Schedule:**
- **Quarterly Updates**: After BEA's third estimate release (~3 months after quarter end)
- **Annual Comprehensive**: After BEA's September annual update
- **As Needed**: For methodological revisions or historical corrections

**Next Recommended Update:** After Q3 2025 third estimate (expected late January 2026)

## Comparison with Other Economic Indicators

GDP should be considered alongside:
- **Employment Data**: Labor market strength indicator
- **Inflation (CPI)**: Price level changes (see Substrate's US-Inflation dataset)
- **Industrial Production**: Manufacturing and goods production
- **Consumer Spending**: Largest component of GDP (~70%)
- **Business Investment**: Capital formation and expansion
